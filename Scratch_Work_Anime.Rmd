Ok here we go, lets try to make an animated barplot for 2015-2020 seasons showing forced fumble leaders as time moves

```{r}
seasons <- 2015:2019

pbp15.19 <- purrr::map_df(seasons, function(x) {
  readRDS(
    url(
      glue::glue("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guga31bb/nflfastR-data/master/data/play_by_play_{x}.rds")
    )
  )
})

seasons <- 2020

pbp20 <- purrr::map_df(seasons, function(x) {
  readRDS(
    url(
      glue::glue("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guga31bb/nflfastR-data/master/data/play_by_play_{x}.rds")
    )
  )
})
```
ok, we want something similar to this I think
```{r}
# marlon.test.15_19 <- reg.szn.pbp15_19 %>%
#   filter(forced_fumble_player_1_player_name == "M.Humphrey") %>% 
#   select(game_date, forced_fumble_player_1_player_name, receiver_player_name, yards_gained, yards_after_catch)
# marlon.test.20 <- reg.szn.pbp20 %>%
#   filter(forced_fumble_player_1_player_name == "M.Humphrey") %>% 
#   select(game_date, forced_fumble_player_1_player_name, receiver_player_name, yards_gained, yards_after_catch)
# #most this year for any position
# marcus.test.15_19 <- reg.szn.pbp15_19 %>%
# filter(interception_player_name == "M.Peters") %>% 
#   select(game_date, interception_player_name, receiver_player_name, yards_gained, yards_after_catch)
# marcus.test.20 <- reg.szn.pbp20 %>%
# filter(interception_player_name == "M.Peters") %>% 
#   select(game_date, interception_player_name, receiver_player_name, yards_gained, yards_after_catch)
# 
# Marlo_Fruit_Punch <- rbind(marlon.test.15_19, marlon.test.20)
# 
# MP_Juice_Man <- rbind(marcus.test.15_19, marcus.test.20)
# 
# Marlo_Fruit_Punch
# 
# MP_Juice_Man
```
We're going to want to group by forced_fumble_1_player_name, then we will also need the year

```{r}
head(pbp20)
#so we have game date, lets select some columns
DF <- rbind(pbp15.19, pbp20)


DF1 <- DF %>% 
  separate(game_date, sep = "-", into = c("Year", "Month", "Day.Date")) %>% 
  select(game_id, Year, week, forced_fumble_player_1_player_name) %>% 
  filter(Year == 2020) %>% 
  rename("Name" = forced_fumble_player_1_player_name) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Name)) %>% 
  group_by(week, Name) %>% 
  summarise(Count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(week)
DF1

DF.Final <- DF1 %>% 
  select(week, Name, Count)
write.csv(DF.Final, "Derived_Data/Frcd.Fumb.Anim.Barplot.csv")
```

Ok, so after all that we have 6 sets with the counts of each player and aggregations on those I think it we are ready to make our 6 plots. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
Data.Anime <- read.csv("Derived_Data/Frcd.Fumb.Anim.Barplot.csv")

```

so, 273 people recovered at least 1 fumble, what if we changed this to be atleast 2, that way the bar chart will look a bit more interesting. 

```{r}
#this removes postseason and the people that only had one week with a forced fumble, this will give us some more movement. 
Frcd.Fumb.Peop <- Data.Anime %>% 
  filter(week <= 16) %>% 
  group_by(Name) %>% 
  filter(n() > 2)
  

Frcd.Fumb.Peop %>% filter(Name == "M.Humphrey")
#now, since I can't for the life of me figure out another way to do this, I'm going to split them all up by week, then make sure week 1 contains every person, then I'll have to carefully add people when they come in and make sure for the enxt week the number stays the same if the did not get a fumble. This may be tough
```

```{r}
#lets build a week 0 with every player
FF0.re <- data.frame("week" = 0,
                  "Name" = unique(Frcd.Fumb.Peop$Name), 
                  "Count" = 0)
#adding .re, we are going to rebuild every data frame week by week with joins and mixing NAs

FF1.re[is.na(FF1.re)] <- 0
#ok, this is now correct for week 1, now this issue will be making sure the week 1 carry over to week 2 and change if they got a fumble, im thinking we copy FF1.re, change the week to 2, then join?

######## Week 2 #########
FF2 <- Frcd.Fumb.Peop %>% 
  filter(week == 2) %>% 
  select(-X)

FF1.Copy <- FF1.re
